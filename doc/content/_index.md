The Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN is an open-source LoRaWAN network stack suitable for large, global and geo-distributed public and private networks as well as smaller networks. The architecture follows the LoRaWAN Network Reference Model for standards compliancy and interoperability.

LoRaWAN is a protocol for low-power wide area networks. It allows for large scale Internet of Things deployments where low-powered devices efficiently communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.
