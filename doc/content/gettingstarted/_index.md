This is a guide for setting up a private LoRaWAN Network Server using The Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN.

In this guide we will get everything up and running using Docker. If you are comfortable with configuring servers and working with command line, this is the perfect place to start.

### CLI and stack

The web interface Console is not yet available. So in this tutorial, we use the command-line interface (CLI) to manage the setup.

The CLI can be configured to connect to your local machine or the cloud.

>Note: if you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases.
