## <a name="login">Login using the CLI</a>

The CLI needs to be logged on in order to create gateways, applications, devices and API keys. With the stack running in one terminal session, login with the following command:

```bash
$ ttn-lw-cli login
```

A link will be provided to the OAuth login page where you can login using the credentials from the step ahead. Once you logged in in the browser, return to the terminal session to proceed.
